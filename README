Known issues:
1. Due to unknown compatibility problem with AFS, Cassandra occasionally gets filesystem error.
If that happens, please use ps to get the process id, kill it and restart cassandra with script we provided.

3. we use ports 25536 ~ 25540 and 25555, it rarely conflicts with other students. If it does, please contact us.
